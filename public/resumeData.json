    "bio":"With my degree in Mathematics, I have always had a knack for solving problems.  Recently graduated from the Coding Boot Camp at the University of Texas - Austin, I have learned many new skills in Full Stack Application Development. The Boot Camp focused on full stack technologies such as, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory (SQL, Mongoose) and Git/GitBash. I am currently looking to get into the Tech industry and expand on what I have already learned.  Feel free to take a look at some of my projects in the 'Works' section, or download my resume from the 'Download Resume' link below!",
